## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This was my first project using CSS Grid and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be! However, I am sure there's a more effecient way to make the component more responsive. I will continue to push myself and explore the depths of grid to become better at recognizing and creating similar patterns.

### Continued development
 
I will continue to improve using CSS grid. Reading the documentation really helped me to understand certain properties. The combination of that and actually building out sites will do help me to deeply understand the concepts I am using.

I will also continue to modify the carousel component to make it as close as possible to the sketch file.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me to begin to understand grid and how it's properties effect the layout of the component. 
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zBsdzdE4sM) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
